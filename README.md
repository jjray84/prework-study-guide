Prework Study Guide Webpage
This is a prework study guide that I completed in order to have a better grasp of basic concepts of coding prior to starting Georgia Tech bootcamp in December of 2022. Throughout the prework section of the bootcamp, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, as well as JavaScript.

While you are looking through this Prework Study Guide, you will notice a few notes on each topic covered, as well as links to cheat sheets that I personally found useful in each topic box. Please take a moment to open DevTools (right click on the main screen, select the bottom most option called 'inspect', and select 'console' from the menu that opens)

License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to https://choosealicense.com/.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
