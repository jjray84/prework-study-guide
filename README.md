Prework Study Guide Webpage
This is a prework study guide that I completed in order to have a better grasp of basic concepts of coding prior to starting Georgia Tech bootcamp in December of 2022. Throughout the prework section of the bootcamp, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, as well as JavaScript.

While you are looking through this Prework Study Guide, you will notice a few notes on each topic covered, as well as links to cheat sheets that I personally found useful in each topic box. Please take a moment to open DevTools (right click on the main screen, select the bottom most option called 'inspect', and select 'console' from the menu that opens) to have the program give you a topic to study.
