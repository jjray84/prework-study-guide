Prework Study Guide Webpage
This is a prework study guide that I completed in order to have a better grasp of basic concepts of coding prior to starting Georgia Tech bootcamp in December of 2022. Throughout the prework section of the bootcamp, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, as well as JavaScript.

While you are looking through this Prework Study Guide, you will notice a few notes on each topic covered, as well as links to cheat sheets that I personally found useful in each topic box. Please take a moment to open DevTools (right click on the main screen, select the bottom most option called 'inspect', and select 'console' from the menu that opens)
